Render component in a jest test\r\n\r\n\r\nLink to code example: https://codesandbox.io/s/long-sound-xhe5w?file=/package.json\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\n\r\nA error is logged for each call of `useEffect`.\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\n\r\nAn error per component calling `useEffect`.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nCurrent errror:\r\n```\r\nWarning: An update to Component ran an effect, but was not wrapped in act(...).\r\n\r\nWhen testing, code that causes React state updates should be wrapped into act(...):\r\n\r\nact(() => {\r\n  /* fire events that update state */\r\n});\r\n/* assert on the output */\r\n\r\nThis ensures that you're testing the behavior the user would see in the browser. Learn more at https://fb.me/react-wrap-tests-with-act\r\n    at Component (https://xhe5w.csb.app/src/index.test.js:23:20)\r\n    at App (https://xhe5w.csb.app/src/index.test.js:35:20)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe prescription is to wrap the update in act(). The warning may be unintented because a component with an effect rendered unexpectedly. But due to the rules of hooks it's unlikely that we remove a `useEffect` call: It's easier to prevent rendering a component (wrong branch logic, return early etc) than preventing an effect (which requires moving it to a component we render conditionally).\r\n\r\nFrom my experience most of these cases come down to adding an `act()` and not changing component implementation. In these cases firing errors for each effect makes the console output unreadable. Especially if you have compose custom hooks and end up with 4+ effects per component.\r\n\r\nAn alternate solution would be to only fire an error if the effect was actually scheduled (see #19318).\r\n",

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\r\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReact version: `0.0.0-experimental-4c8c98ab9` with concurrent mode. \r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. In the provided code sandbox, click on a `Todo` component\r\n2. Tab back and forth between the two \r\n3. At inconsistent times, there will be a frame where the focus hasn't left, but the outline isn't rendered. The outline is only drawn when focus is in. Because there is a brief frame without the border, the todo visibly flickers. \r\n\r\nLink to code example: \r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/samc-focus-demo-9jyso?file=/package.json:201-229\r\n\r\nVideo; https://drive.google.com/file/d/18PW8M_VvE3Nau7NkdQq4X8En_Vcen_xQ/view?usp=sharing\r\nFocus shifts multiple times at the beginning, without a flicker. \r\nAround the 6 seconds mark, there is a flicker.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhoto of the frame; \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/787007/87840493-3e811600-c8e3-11ea-8323-076faaabc8c7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\n\r\nAt times there is an 'impossible' frame, where the focus has been set to false, despite the focus just having shifted from one element to another within the same div. \r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\nI'm not sure if this pattern is something that is concurrent mode incompatible or something... \r\n\r\nBut regardless, I'd expect the behaviour to be consistent - eg for `focus` and `blur` events to be combined into a single frame.\r\n\r\nThis codepen shows the expected outcome with vanila JS https://codepen.io/samcooke98/pen/OJMaXvx\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related?\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/19385\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Using concurrent mode on `0.0.0-experimental-7f28234f8` makes `<Checkbox/>` from Baseweb stop firing `onChange` events.\r\n\r\nBaseweb is a popular set of React components that reflects real world usage patterns such that maybe it should work right off the bat with Concurrent mode. Feel free to close if you're confident this is a userland problem and not a framework problem, but I think this may indicate an incompatibility between Concurrent Mode and Legacy mode that isn't documented or warned about it if so, because `<Checkbox/>` isn't doing anything too fancy and doesn't use deprecated APIs or warn when rendered in Strict mode or Concurrent mode. I feel like that means it's supposed to just work, right? \r\n\r\nReact version: `0.0.0-experimental-7f28234f8`\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Click a `<Checkbox/>` rendered using Legacy mode and note that it checks\r\n2. Click a `<Checkbox/>` rendered using Concurrent mode and note that it does not check \r\n\r\nSee issue here: https://baseweb-react-concurrent-checkbox.stackblitz.io (edit here: https://stackblitz.com/edit/baseweb-react-concurrent-checkbox?file=src/index.js)\r\n\r\nI've been trying to debug and haven't found any smoking guns yet, but there are some interesting tidbits I can share that might allude to if this is a React bug or a Baseweb bug:\r\n - `onFocus` and `onBlur` handlers fire just fine on both modes \r\n - `<Checkbox/>` doesn't use `findDOMNode` or other deprecated APIs in Concurrent mode as best I can tell. No warnings are fired when rendering it in Strict mode or Concurrent + Strict mode\r\n - focusing the `Checkbox` by tabbing and pressing space checks and fires the `onChange` handler on both Legacy and Concurrent mode\r\n - Wide swaths of the rest of baseweb work just fine in Concurrent mode\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/uber/baseweb/issues/3476 for the `baseweb` issue.",

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `master`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test-prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n  Learn more about contributing: https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n<!-- Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->\r\nThis pull request adds a workaround for the React-DevTools iframe support issue ( #18945).\r\nIt contains the modified [regression test](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/d897c35ecfb7471b55e41933fd4d993b98dbf600/fixtures/devtools/regression/server.js).\r\n\r\nFor this to work `\"all_frames\": true` should be set in the browser extension, which @dmail had mentioned.\r\nBy adding the below code inside an iframe, fixes this issue:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfor (const key in __REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__) {\r\n      __REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__[key] = parent.__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__[key]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI don't clearly understand the reason why the below code doesn't work, So, I need @bvaughn help to better understand the reason behind this.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__ = parent.__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__; \r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![react_devtools_iframe_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19655674/87407845-53f2f900-c5e0-11ea-8409-d71a08f23c89.png)\r\n\r\nAfter adding the workaround:\r\n![react_dev_tools_issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19655674/87407828-4fc6db80-c5e0-11ea-88f9-6674c8c1a7c2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\n<!-- Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface. -->\r\n\r\nI have modified the regression test, So, that you can test this workaround.\r\nYou can run the regression test with the below commands:\r\n\r\n1. `node ./fixtures/devtools/regression/server.js`\r\n2. `cd packages/react-devtools-extensions/`\r\n3. `yarn build:chrome`\r\n4. `yarn test:chrome`\r\n5. Open `localhost:3000` in the browser.\r\n\r\n",

Receive missing act warning\r\n\r\n\r\nLink to code example: https://codesandbox.io/s/missing-act-on-every-effect-ldy3b?file=/src/index.test.js\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\n\r\nReact creates warnings for each call of React.useEffect regardless of whether an effect was actually scheduled i.e. the effect was run.\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\n\r\nIf it is impossible for an effect to be run I shouldn't have to wrap it in act. Changing the behavior would help identifying what effects were unexpectedly scheduled. Right now we receive warnings for effects that are unrelated to a specific update.\r\n\r\nI consider the current warning misleading and unnecessary because the [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing-recipes.html#act) talks about \"all updates related to these “units”\" which is not the case here in my opinion. The act warning says \"When testing, code that causes React state updates should be wrapped into act(...):\" which also doesn't apply here: The code in question could not cause a state update from an effect.\r\n",

Each action dispatch is wrapped in `unstable_trace`.\r\n\r\nNote I did try to reduce the test case further to see if I could reproduce without Redux and React Redux, but to no avail. However, due to the fact that the state updates occur—we're just missing the interactions—I believe this problem is not due to either of those libraries.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\r\n  have dependencies other than React.

The parent interaction is missing.\r\n\r\nThe test case is logging interactions to the console so you can verify there.\r\n\r\nHere's a screenshot to show what I mean.

But it could be smarter, because they were all defined by `useCallback(() => {}, [])` meaning they will all remain the same value throughout the lifetime of this component.\r\n\r\nGiven this information I could write \r\n```js\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    if (mouseDown) {\r\n      document.addEventListener('mousemove', onMouseMove);\r\n      document.addEventListener('mouseup', onMouseUp);\r\n      return () => {\r\n        document.removeEventListener('mousemove', onMouseMove);\r\n        document.removeEventListener('mouseup', onMouseUp);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }, [mouseDown, onMouseMove, onMouseUp]);\r\n```\r\nTo satisfy the linter and that would work but only because I know they were defined by `useCallback(() => {}, [])`. If someone were to change the dependency array for `onMouseMove` or `onMouseUp` this would now break (the event listeners won't be removed and readded if `onMouseMove` changes for instance), but the linter will be happy.\r\n\r\nHowever if I was able to specify it like I did in the first example it is the same as saying, this works as long as these specific variables don't change, if someone unwittingly changes the dependency array of `onMouseMove` the linter would shout at them again and they would have to rewrite this into something more flexible.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the way `useCallback` doesn't complain about my usage of `setMouseDown` as it knows it can't change.",

    "body": "Hello, recently we've overhauled a client's website with the usage of [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/). It's been an enjoyable experience, however one thing that really irks me - given the project is pretty large and there's multiple people working on it, sometimes it gets chaotic which component is exactly what and you need to find out which component you should be working on.\r\n\r\nMy general fallback was using the [React Develeloper Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) extension, however given MUI consists of ready-made JSX components, it essentially spams and halts the usefulness of the 'Components' tab.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17268815/85140844-25cf0300-b246-11ea-98ec-e0d37aea2707.png)\r\n\r\nIs there perhaps any way that would allow for filtering of specific packages / jsx elements inside the React Developer Tools?\r\n\r\nI know I could technically user regex to filter out a list of all the known MUI Components, but that seems bit overkill.  I sadly suspect such a thing is not supported, but you never know unless you ask.\r\n",

They were never garbage collected. After pairing back my use case I was able to narrow it to a very specific repro.\r\n\r\n**If you have a React component that instantiates a ResizeObserver AND captures the result of React.useState, it will never get garbage collected.**\r\n\r\nI'm not positive, but I assume that the full React component is leaking in these cases, although I can only see the canvas contexts leaking because that's what Safari devtools makes easy to see.\r\n\r\n### Code\r\n\r\n**Leak repro:**\r\nIf you mount and unmount this `SizedCanvas` component over and over the canvas contexts will leak.\r\n```javascript\r\nconst LeakyResizeDetector = () => {\r\n    const x = React.useState(false)\r\n\r\n    React.useEffect(() => {\r\n        const observer = new ResizeObserver(() => null)\r\n        return () => observer.disconnect()\r\n    }, [])\r\n\r\n    return <div />\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst SizedCanvas = () => {\r\n  return <>\r\n    <LeakyResizeDetector />\r\n    <canvas ref={ref => ref && ref.getContext('2d')} />\r\n  </>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Clean repro:**\r\nIf you mount and unmount this `SizedCanvas` component over and over the canvas contexts will get garbage collected and you'll remain in a clean state.\r\n```javascript\r\nconst CleanResizeDetector = () => {\r\n    React.useState(false)\r\n\r\n    React.useEffect(() => {\r\n        const observer = new ResizeObserver(() => null)\r\n        return () => observer.disconnect()\r\n    }, [])\r\n\r\n    return <div />\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst SizedCanvas = () => {\r\n  return <>\r\n    <CleanResizeDetector />\r\n    <canvas ref={ref => ref && ref.getContext('2d')} />\r\n  </>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only difference between these two examples is that the leaky component captures the result of the `useState` call. Other than that they are identical.\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\nCanvas contexts infinitely collect and never get garbage collected.\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\nCanvas contexts get garbage collected as their React components get unmounted.\r\n",

    "body": "On previous versions of react, functional components were always re-rendered unless they were memoized. With the latest version, if the props do not change the component does not re-render. While this is an improvement in general, there are certain scenarios where you want to force a re-render, for example to react to some user input that does not change the value, but requires to make operations on the dom. A great example is an input field, where you may need to reposition the cursor even if the input content is the same\r\n\r\nReact version: 16.13.0\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a controlled input component\r\n2. Handle the state from the parent, for example using useStateHook\r\n3. Make the state behave to set the input-value to the same value when the user inputs certain value, for example, behave normal for any input except when the user types \"aa\", then you set the value to always the same \"aa\" one, not allowing the user to enter more than two `a`\r\n3. Even if you add an useEffect inside the input component, the component is not re-rendered\r\n\r\n\r\nLink to code example:\r\n\r\nhttps://codepen.io/danielo515/pen/KKVdmye?editors=0010\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\n\r\nThe component does not get re-render if the provided props do not change, even if there is a useEffect hook inside.\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe functional component should re-render unless it is memoized, or at least take in account if there is an use effect hook.\r\n\r\nWhile this may look stupid from the provided example, imagine a controlled number input that automatically formats the user input, adding two decimal positions at the end `.00`. When the user reaches the dot, he/she may expect to input a dot and let the cursor move after the existing one, however, because the final value hasn't changed (there text still ends at `.00` thanks to automatic formatting) the component is not re-rendered, making impossible to re-position the cursor using useEffect hook.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, you can add an use-state hook inside the controlled component, so you can store there the raw user input, but that only works until the user tries to input a value that doesn't change the internal state.",

    "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nMutating a given ref's `current` property as the result of a render or hook call is not safe in concurrent mode. The reason for this is described [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14099#issuecomment-440794435).\r\n\r\nAs an example, this is not safe:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst MyComponent = React.memo({ someProp }) => {\r\n  const myRef = useRef();\r\n\r\n  myRef.current = someProp;\r\n\r\n  // ...\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis also wouldn't be safe:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst useMyCustomHook = () => {\r\n  const [someState, setSomeState] = useState('');\r\n  const myRef = useRef();\r\n\r\n  myRef.current = someState;\r\n\r\n  // ...\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere currently isn't a guard rail in place to prevent applications not written for concurrent mode first to easily identify this problem before the application is opted-in to concurrent mode. Without a guard rail, applications that move from non-concurrent mode to concurrent mode are at some point are at a serious risk of experiencing cumbersome regressions as a result of the move.\r\n\r\nSo, I'm proposing an ESLint rule that fails in the case that any top-level ref mutations are found and suggests that they be moved into either `useEffect` or `useLayoutEffect` hook calls so that way the mutation only occurs in the case that a commit to render has happened.\r\n\r\nAt the time that this PR is opened, the rule is called `safe-ref-mutations`. It is initially not marked as recommended because I'd like to get some core React contributor guidance first.\r\n\r\nThis rule didn't seem to fit in with either `rules-of-hooks` or `exhaustive-deps`, so I wrote it as its own rule. If there's a preference to move it into one or the other, I'm happy to do so. But in general, I wonder if there are more rules that React should have in place for safe concurrency mode usage. Maybe some kind of `safe-concurrency` rule would be better?\r\n\r\nAs part of this PR, I needed some functions that accomplished the same as those in `RulesOfHooks.js`, so I've extracted them into a `utils.js` for re-use.\r\n\r\nIf there's a preference that I open an issue for this, I'm happy to do so.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nThe ESLint rule will be heavily tested if this is the route that is chosen.\r\n",

React Hooks must be called in a React function component or a custom React Hook function.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf a named function is used it works, but it is far from ideal (e.g. name repetition):\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport const MyComponent = memo(\r\n    mobxObserver(\r\n        function MyComponent(props: IMyComponentProps) {\r\n          // React.useLayoutEffect(...) // won't warn\r\n        }\r\n))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to have a custom whitelist of methods that are allowed to wrap the functional component without raising this warning?

Logging the pending value, it goes true for an instant, but immediately reverts back to false. \r\n\r\nIf you modify the hardReset call to NOT pass startTransition anymore, and repeat, and you should see the Suspense fallback trigger.\r\n\r\nSo Suspense appears to be working, but useTransition is bailing out for some reason.  I tried this with latest built off of master, but no change.\r\n\r\nObviously setting your network speed to Slow 3G will help repro this. Also, please feel free to edit this data as you wish - any changes you make will be automatically reverted every hour.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\r\n  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or\r\n  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLink to code example:\r\n\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a\r\n  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the\r\n  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is\r\n  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal\r\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\n\r\nPending indicator should stay true after a call to startTransition suspends\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt does not.

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `master`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test-prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) typechecks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n  Learn more about contributing: https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->\r\n\r\n[`babel.getEnv()`](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/f6c7bf36cec81baaba8c37e572985bb59ca334b1/packages/babel-core/src/config/helpers/environment.js) ignores Babel's [`envName`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/options#envname) option that can be used, for example, when calling `transformFromAst` from `@babel/core` directly. This can throw an error if `skipEnvCheck == false` and `process.env.BABEL_ENV !== 'development'`.\r\n\r\nUsing [`babel.env()`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files#apienv) prioritizes `envName` over `process.env.<x>` values and resolves the issue.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\n<!-- Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface. -->\r\nAdded a test. If I change `babel.env()` back to `babel.getEnv()`, the test fails.",

Debugging info: If an element gets created while rendering an arbitrary fiber, we want to \"remember\" that for DevTools and some warning messages.\r\n\r\nThese purposes are currently conflated because we only have `element._owner`. This field is set inconsistently, e.g. it's set in production only for classes, but in development it's set while rendering function components too. This makes it hard to remove in the future when we remove String Refs.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we split these two purposes into `element._owner` (populated from `ReactCurrentOwner.current`) and `element._debugOwner` (populated from `ReactDebugCurrentFrame.debugOwner`).\r\n\r\nOnly String Refs now rely on `element._owner`, so in this PR we no longer set `ReactCurrentOwner.current` for other Fiber types. The DEV-only cases rely on `element._debugOwner`.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Possibly revert the MountInderterminateComponent case. We may need this if refs worked for Factory Components before.\r\n- [ ] Change DevTools to rely on `_debugOwner` for \"rendered by\" breadcrumbs.\r\n  - [ ] Perhaps, this means we need to flip it, add a PROD `_refOwner` field, and then keep `_owner` as the DEV-only one? Then we won't need to change DevTools.\r\n- [ ] Maybe, put `isRendering` onto `ReactDebugCurrentFrame`.",

I could switch to CRA but I figured in case we want to add something server-side, Next might be easier to play with.\r\n\r\nThis experiment is called Frame because the mental model is very close to the old school HTML frames. All routing happens on the \"server\", so the links need to \"know\" which \"frame\" they're targeting.\r\n\r\nThe interesting part is `App.js`. It's split in a few sections: server product code, server infra code, and client infra code. I tried to follow the rules, i.e. client components don't use server components. There is an exception in the match rendering logic (because we need an entry point into the server for partial frames), but that part should be fully serializable.\r\n\r\nI left some comments inline. There's a few notable pieces:\r\n\r\n- `<Frame entry=\"EntryPointName\" />` renders a route handler. The rendering is delegated to the actual named entry point. For partial updates, that entry point is conceptually the root. \r\n- Frames on the server set up a \"frame context\". Links on the server use it to \"ask\" which Frame the link should target. The closest ancestor Frame that is able to handle the URL responds with its keypath and the hosted content.\r\n- Links on the server pass the target Frame keypath and the content (which in reality would be something like an entry point URL rather than a tree) to the client Link.\r\n- Client Link, when clicked, will find the ancestor Client Frame with the target provided by the Server Link. It will then tell the Client Frame to show the content embedded in the Link.\r\n- On the server, Frames push their entry names into the context (a \"cursor\"). Server Links will pass a serialized version of this context to the Client Link as part of the content.\r\n- When we request the partial view from the server, we will restore the Frame hierarchy above the requested subtree, based on the serialized context. This is how Link-Frame matching works for subsequent navigations on the server.\r\n- There is an input to demonstrate that the client state lines up during compatible updates.\r\n\r\nFollow-ups:\r\n\r\n- [x] Proper URL handling (the current one is very naïve and consumes one segment at a time).\r\n- [x] Active link status.\r\n\r\nUnresolved:\r\n\r\n- Where does the cache live?\r\n- How is the Back button handled?\r\n- What would a realistic entry point API look like?\r\n- CSRF token to protect from request forgery.\r\n- Fallback mechanics when the server can't resume a child frame.",

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\r\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen react is inside an iframe, chrome extension for react devtools fails to detect react.\r\n\r\nThis is because the extension sets `__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__` only on the top level window. Apparently it's possible to have `__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__` on iframes too by adding `all_frames: true` in extension [manifest.json](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/c390ab3643612dc08ca4bebadc5b0377e9e7eb79/packages/react-devtools-extensions/chrome/manifest.json#L49). It was done by redux devtools extension in https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension/pull/56.\r\n\r\nHave you considered adding `all_frames: true` to chrome extension ?\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a file `react-main.html`\r\n```html\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html>\r\n  <head>\r\n    <script crossorigin src=\"https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js\"></script>\r\n    <script crossorigin src=\"https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js\"></script>\r\n  </head>\r\n  <body></body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n```\r\n2. Create a file `react-iframe.html`\r\n```html\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html>\r\n  <head></head>\r\n  <body>\r\n    <iframe src=\"./react-main.html\" />\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n3. Open `react-iframe.html` in chrome\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a\r\n  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the\r\n  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is\r\n  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal\r\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\n\r\n![react-devtools-not-detected](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/443639/82196553-21879100-98fa-11ea-932b-b9f49a4079c7.png)\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\n\r\n![react-devtools-detected](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/443639/82196588-2cdabc80-98fa-11ea-925d-186e8c999f44.png)\r\n\r\nPull request: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/18952\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Which I think it's not correct, and that is not what I need.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43407798/82043569-ba709f00-96a3-11ea-874e-121297d06b43.png)\r\n\r\nI don't know what versions the CodeSandbox environment is using.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt should be asking for the `location.pathname` property, instead of the full `location` object.\r\n\r\n## NOTE\r\n\r\nThis issue seems to be different than https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16265 , because that one is caused when you call a method straight from the object, without destructuring it first. This issue is happening when using a property, not a method.",
